    "In this homework, you're going to apply the data wrangling and visualization skills you've learnt in the past 7 weeks to get a good understanding of the dataset and build a ML model to predict which passengers survived the **sinking of the Titanic**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The type of machine learning you will be doing is called classification, because when we make predictions we are classifying each passenger as survived or not. More specifically, we are performing binary classification, which means that there are only two different states we are classifying.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any machine learning exercise, thinking about the topic you are predicting is very important. We call this step acquiring domain knowledge, and it's one of the most important determinants for success in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, understanding the Titanic disaster and specifically what variables might affect the outcome of survival is important. For example, anyone who has watched the movie Titanic would remember that women and children were given preference to lifeboats (as they were in real life). You would also remember the vast class disparity of the passengers. This indicates that Age, Sex, and PClass may be good predictors of survival.\n",
