    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a function that gives a probability to any event that might occur in an experiment. The simplest probability distribution is the binomial distribution, which can take on *n* outcomes. A 6-sided dice follows a binomial distribution with 6 possible outcomes, each side having some probability of landing up, and all the probabilities of all the sides sum to 1. An RV example of an event that follows the binomial distribution is the probability of someone converting. We can use the conversion rate, a value between 0 and 1, to describe the probability that any individual will convert. Note that the events will always be 0, didn't convert, or 1, but the conversion rate will take on a rational value between 0 and 1.\n",

Typically, we are tasked with the reverse problem. That is, we are given access to some observed data, and asked to infer what the true conversion rate is. This process is called \"statistical inference\" and it is a core concept to all of data science and machine learning.
