## Week 1 Introduction to Data Science and Python

### Videos
In this section, we are going to begin getting familiar with the field of Data Science and exploring the Python programming language. Let's start by watching this week's video lessons:

* [The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Boot Camp](https://redventures.udemy.com/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/learn/lecture/10762798#content)
  * Sections 1 - 6
  * Section 22: Lessons 137, 138, 139

### Homework
In the above videos we've covered:
* Python
  * [Python](https://www.python.org) is a high-level programming language that is easy to code and understand. It also has wide applications in multiple industries and domains. Last but not least, Python is open-source so it is free to use!
* Jupyter Notebook
  * [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is an open-source web application that allows you to code and share documents with live code. Python is one of the coding languages it supports.

Instead of installing Jupyter Notebook on your local computer, we will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for all 100 level coding exercises and homework. Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that are hosted by Google Colab. You don't need to worry about installing python and related packages for exercises and homework. 
Watch this video on [Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&v=inN8seMm7UI) for a quick introduction.

Once you finish the Google Colab introduction video complete the following four items:
1. Create a text cell that has a header saying `Introduction to Python.` (Reminder: headers are created by using the "#" symbol followed by your text).
2. Create a second text cell that has normal text saying `This is how we print something to the screen using Python:`
3. Below the previous two cells, create a code cell and put `python print('Hello 2024 Accelerator!')`.
4. Run the code cell.

#### If you get stuck:
* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* [Here](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed) is a overview of how to write markdown.
* Also, google searches of ```how to do x in markdown``` will be helpful. Ex: ```How to make a heading in markdown```
