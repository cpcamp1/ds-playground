## Connecting to Data

This week you need to make sure you have a valid data source to answer your problem statement.
You'll need to connect to the data source with Datagrip or another SQL IDE and pull down a data sample. From there, this week's 
requirements are to submit a Jupyter notebook that contains the following:

* The first 20 rows of the data source
* Summary statistics of each column including:
  * Percent null
  * mean, median, 1Q, 3Q for numeric variables
  * cardinality, percent of top 4 categories of categorial variables

Name this file `data_validation.ipynb` and submit it to your final repo.
