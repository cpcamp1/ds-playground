## Meeting With Breakout Leader

Your breakout leader will be working with you to answer the following questions about your project:

- [ ] Does the proposed research problem have business value?
- [ ] Will you be able to obtain the data necessary to answer the research question?
- [ ] Is the scope of the research problem appropriate for the amount of time and your skill level?

If the answer to any of these questions is no, you'll need to work quickly to modify the problem or find a new one.
