## Your Final Presentation

This is it! Your final presentation. Your deliverables should include the following:
* A 5 minute presentation, with up to 5 minutes of questions from the audience
* No more than 5 slides
* A Jupyter notebook and any other code you used in the project
* A 1-2 page paper (no longer) with a summary of your findings and recommendations

You should assume that the audience will include both data scientists and business stakeholders. This means you need to both 
be able to explain with sufficient technical detail but also be clear enough that a less technical person can understand
your findings.

Lastly, PLEASE hold yourself to the 5 minutes on the presentation. We have a number of people who will be presenting, and we 
want to respect everyone's time.
