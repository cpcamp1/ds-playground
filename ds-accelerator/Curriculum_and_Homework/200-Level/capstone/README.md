## Capstone Final Project

While continuing to learn in the 200-Level, you'll also have the opportunity to apply your learnings to a real business problem that you or your team are facing. The following assignments will be completed in tandem with your normal 200-Level homework. 

### Week of 09/30/2024: Establish Research Question
* Establish Research Question for your Capstone:
	* Determine a research question. 
		* Not sure what to do your capstone on? Take some inspiration from former grads: [Project Examples](https://github.com/RedVentures/homegrown-2024/blob/main/Curriculum_and_Homework/200-Level/capstone/project-examples.md)
		* Not sure if you're doing the "right" business question? Use [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dg91ae5j7M8q3V28RYPH_afAcuOO46Ee7Mxx57eB2FA/edit) to help you out!
		* If all else fails, get some advice from your breakout leader!
	* Once you've determined your research question:
		* Create a capstone folder in the root of your GitHub repository. In that folder, commit a file called proposal.md
			* Use this [Proposal Template](https://github.com/RedVentures/homegrown-2024/blob/main/Curriculum_and_Homework/200-Level/capstone/proposal.md) to outline your proposal

### Week of 10/07/2024: Meet with your Breakout Leader to get Approval
* Now that you've established a research question, meet with your breakout leader to get their thoughts and approval. 
* [Approval Questions](https://github.com/RedVentures/homegrown-2024/blob/main/Curriculum_and_Homework/200-Level/capstone/project-approval.md)

### Week of 10/14/2024: Establish Connection to Data
