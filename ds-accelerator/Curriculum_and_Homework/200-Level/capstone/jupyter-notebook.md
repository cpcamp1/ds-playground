## Jupyter Notebook

During this week you should finish your code/analysis. In your repo, please include the following:

* A .sql file containing the query you used to obtain your research data
* A jupyter notebook that cleans your data, answers questions, generates visuals, etc. as relevant to your research questions(s)
* The notebook should be easy for a third party to read and understand. Expect others to look at your code.
