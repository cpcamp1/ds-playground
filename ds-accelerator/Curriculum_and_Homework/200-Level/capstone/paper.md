## Final Paper

Your final 1-2 page paper should include sections such as:

* An executive summary of findings
* Visual(s) of findings
* Text that describes the visual
* Text that describes any recommendations
* You should be able to hand off this paper to a decision maker, and they could make an informed decision with very little additional explanation

Please do not go over 2 pages. This is not intended to be a Ph.D. thesis.
