#### Capstone Homework
* Establish Research Question for your Capstone:
	* Determine a research question. 
		* Not sure what to do your capstone on? Take some inspiration from former grads: [Project Examples](https://github.com/RedVentures/homegrown-2024/blob/main/Curriculum_and_Homework/200-Level/capstone/project-examples.md)
		* Not sure if you're doing the "right" business question? Use [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dg91ae5j7M8q3V28RYPH_afAcuOO46Ee7Mxx57eB2FA/edit) to help you out!
		* If all else fails, get some advice from your breakout leader!
	* Once you've determined your research question:
		* Create a capstone folder in the root of your GitHub repository. In that folder, commit a file called proposal.md
			* Use this [Proposal Template](https://github.com/RedVentures/homegrown-2024/blob/main/Curriculum_and_Homework/200-Level/capstone/proposal.md) to outline your proposal
