Mean centering of a variable value means that we will replace the actual value of the variable with a standardized value, so that the variable has a mean of 0 and variance of 1. This ensures that all the variables are in the same range and the difference in ranges of values doesn't cause the algorithm to not perform well. This is akin to feature scaling.\n",
